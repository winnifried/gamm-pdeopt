     <h2>Statues of the GAMM Activity Group on Optimization with Partial Differential Equations</h2>
     <p>
       1. Aims of the activity group:<br />
       The activity group supports the communication and collaboration of all persons or groups
       involved in scientific and industrial research with an interest in "Optimization with PDE
       constraints". It exclusively and directly pursues scientific objectives which contribute to
       the promotion, spreading and application of the research field "Optimization with PDE
       constraints". The activity group represents the research field "Optimization with PDE
       constraints" within the GAMM and collaborates with similarly oriented organizations in
       Germany and abroad. More detailed information is provided on the websites.
     </p>
     <p>
       2. Membership:<br />
       Anyone interested in "Optimization with PDE constraints" can become a member of the
       activity group. Applications for admission shall be sent to the executive committee which
       will make a decision on acceptance. Membership is terminated either by resignation or
       exclusion. A member who has offended the aims of the committee or damaged its reputation
